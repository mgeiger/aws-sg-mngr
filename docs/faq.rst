Usage
=====

Getting the Python Server up and running:

$ export FLASK_APP=aws_sg_mngr/server.py
$ flask run

We're using the boto library and expect you to configure it under config/boto.cfg with the AWS credentials of the account you're using. We have included conf/boto.cfg.example as a template.


Concepts
========

Why do we want an automatic boilerplate?
----------------------------------------

Because time is precious and we don't want to waste it in repetitive tasks. Copy
and paste can go a long way creating a new project, but is tedious and error
prone. Python boilerplate makes it easy, simple, and beautiful.
